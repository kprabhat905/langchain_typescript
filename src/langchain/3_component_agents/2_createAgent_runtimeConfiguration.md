# 🔐 Runtime Configuration in LangChain Agents (Production Guide)

This document explains **what runtime configuration is**, **how agents consume it**, and **how to design it safely for production systems**.

---

## 1️⃣ What Is Runtime Configuration?

**Runtime configuration** is trusted, server-side data injected into an agent **at execution time**, not generated by the LLM.

It includes things like:
- Authenticated user identity
- Session / thread identifiers
- Feature flags
- Permissions
- Environment-specific values
- Rate limits and safety controls

> 🔑 Runtime config is **never visible to the LLM**.

---

## 2️⃣ Where Runtime Config Lives

Runtime configuration is passed as the **second argument** to `agent.invoke()`:

```ts
const config = {
  configurable: { thread_id: "thread-123" },
  context: { userId: "user-5678" },
  recursionLimit: 6,
};

await agent.invoke(input, config);
